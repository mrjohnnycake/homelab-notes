# Install #

This app is ridiculously easy to set up

- Sign up on the website
- Go to Download on the website and select you OS
	- For Windows and Android, it's an app to download
	- For Linux, it's a shell script to run
- Authenticate the different apps as needed during install
- That's pretty much it



# Usage #

- Make sure that Tailscale is running on the two or more devices you want to connect
- On the Tailscale website under "Machines" you'll see some assigned IP addresses. Just use those as you would a 192.168 IP
	- So if you want to connect to SSH, just do `ssh user@100.###.###.###` and you're good
