## Headers

Headers / Headings can use more hash marks to make smaller text in the final view AND indented items in the outline view. 

You can go up to six hash marks on a header

You don't need the hash mark after the text if you don't want it


## Basic Text Formatting ##

*Italic* or _italic_

**Bold** or __bold__

***Bold and Italic***

~~Strikethrough~~

Change text color <span style="color:green">like this</span> or <span style="color:#FFF8C7">like this</span>

==Highlight==




## Lists ##

1. Numbered lists start with the number
2. followed by a . (don't use a parenthesis)

***

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
	+ Use Ctrl+Enter to do a `-`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!


To do checkboxes quicker, hit Ctrl+Enter twice
- [x] Task lists can show as completed...
- [ ] ... or not completed

I like to use this <br> to create a new line
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is good for separating paragraphs as well!

***

When I do this `it changes the font` up a little bit.

```
This is called code block
```

	It can also be made by pushing tab and then shift tab when you're done.

Lines can be made by typing --- or *** or ___ at a new line, like this:
