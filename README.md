# homelab-notes

This is where I share my personal knowledge base on self-hosting and other homelab topics.

- While I've tried to make all walkthroughs as accurate as possible, some notes are incomplete and are presented for now as starting off points.

- I actually use these notes myself and they get synced to GitHub when I make changes. As I revisit an install I often update the note I'm using to make it better. Some notes I won't really touch again since I don't use that particular service again.

- I use Obsidian as a note taking app and although it is based on Markdown there may be some formatting that is specific to that app.
	- Some notes have links to other notes like this [[GitHub]] which is Obsidian specific. Although I'm sharing my notes I still need them for my own use so you will often see me pointing to a different file that I need to know about. Some of those notes will be available to you and some won't. Just look around for the note in what is shared here.
	- Most notes will have a file creation and modified date on the top which is autocreated from an extension in Obsidian and many dates are wrong anyways because I only recently installed that extension. Just ignore.

- In my lab I name my stuff after MST3k characters and places. Some things may be confusing without knowing that:
	- Deep-13 is my zpool name
	- Tom-Servo, Crow and Gypsy are the names of my servers

- Although it's wasn't my aim to do so, it's entirely possible that someone else's words ended up in my notes somewhere since I take what I find that works and go off of that. As for my notes anyone is allowed to use anything for free and without attribution.

I hope I can help out some rookies with these notes. Send me a message here or email me at mrjohnnycake@gmail.com if you have any questions you'd like answered or even tips about what you think I'm doing wrong.
